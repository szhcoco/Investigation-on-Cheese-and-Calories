<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This is a data science project conducted at UCSD, aiming to investigate on the relationship between the presence of cheese in ingredients and the value of calories. We will walk through the process of data cleaning, checking for missingness dependency, hypothesis testing, building and improving regression models for predictions, as well as performing fairness analysis, to explore the level of significance of cheese and other nutritions that contribute to calories.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As a dairy made from milk, cheese is rich in nutritions that are essential in maintaining and improving health. The major nutritions include calcium for the growth of bones and teeth, protein that support the development and repair of bone tissues, and vitamins like A and B12 as sources of healthy fat. The nutritions cheese contains determine its importance for people of all ages, and esepcially for children who are in the phase of developing bones and muscles.</p>

<p>In addition to its functionality contributing to health, cheese in food tickles our taste buds and can be added into salads, noodles (Mac &amp; Cheese!), rice, any proteins, pizza, soup… literally anything to make the meal delicious!</p>

<p>The datasets from a <a href="https://www.food.com/">recipe recommendation website</a>, containing recipes and their ratings since 2008. The Food website
offers a massive collecion of recipes categorized by popularity, ingredients, cuisines, and meal type. It serves as a platform where recipes are published with photos where people could comment, reply, and post photos to show their work after trying them. It also contains information about ingredients thus we are able to identify recipes containing cheese.</p>

<p>Despite its popularity and importance as an ingredient for food, concerns have been raised about the health issues related to cheese. In addition to its nutritions, cheese are considered as a high-calory ingredient, and over consumption of high-calory food may lead to increase in weight and obesity, diabetes, or heart disease that would risk life.</p>

<p>Our goal in this project is to answer the question of <strong>whether food with cheese tends to have high calories</strong>, as well as to identify nutritions that play an important role in determining the calories of a recipe. By examining the relationship between nutritions and calories, we will provide insights for home cooks to find appealling recipes, enjoying their food while eating healthily, assist creations of balanced meals, and guide food platforms in improving their recommendation system. Based on the diversity and the large volumn of recipes that the website provides, we consider it as a representative dataset for further analysis.</p>

<p>To address our problem, we need to focus on column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nutrition</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ingredient</code>, from which we will extract new values into columns added to the dataframe later in the cleaning process.</p>

<h3 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Clean the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAW_recipes</code> dataframe before merge
    <ul>
      <li>Removing column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unnamed: 0</code> since it does not contain any useful information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Examine the types of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAW_recipes</code> column values</li>

<p>We notice that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nutrition</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ingredients</code> are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">object</code>, so we want to do transforming of these columns.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert each nutrition into single column
    <ul>
      <li>For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nutrition</code>, each row is a lise-list srings storing values in the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]</code>. Since all values are important for later investigation, we want to get access to them easier, so we:
        <ul>
          <li>remove the first and last character of the original nutrition and split the rest by ‘,’.</li>
          <li>use <code class="language-plaintext highl
